              <p>The protection of open space and thoughtful, measured development in our precious Boise foothills is an issue that concerns many Boise residents. People come from far and wide to access these foothills.</p><p>While responsible development is welcomed, many of your neighbors have come together to save an at-risk area in Quail Hollow from poorly designed development. Our campaign, "Save Central Foothills", needs your help to save important open spaces in the area.</p>

              <h2>Development Plans</h2>
              <p>The developer, Colin Connell, and KM Engineers, his contractor, held a meeting on October 9th, 2018 with neighbors to discuss a development proposal/extension of the Eyrie Canyon neighborhood.  The proposal includes two adjacent streets from Villa Ridge Way that would enter a 12-acre lot designated ‘unbuildable’ by the City of Boise.  The owner of this property is Scott Simplot.  The development would climb southwest onto a 62 acre property often called ‘Bedard’, owned by Kipp Bedard.  Six homes are planned on the unbuildable lot, and 30 homes are planned on the Bedard parcel. A stub street shows intent for future development of the Bedard parcel, so more foothills development is quite likely.  While the City of Boise has yet to receive an application, we expect one to be submitted soon.</p>

<p>Neighbors in attendance at the October 9th meeting were united in opposition, along with Central Foothills Neighborhood Association.</p>

              <h2>What's the problem?</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <h3>Fire Danger/Egress</h3>
                  <p>The map provided by the developer showed roads inconsistent with a basic understanding of ingress/egress requirements.  The design seriously threatens public safety.  Fire danger in the foothills is a real threat to homes/people and firefighters require two roads that are not adjacent to one another.  The current plan is to loop the road into developable land, and exit the loop road adjacent to constricted entrance.  There is only one way in/out.  In addition, it is uncertain whether existing neighborhood roads can accommodate firefighting vehicles while evacuation is in progress during emergencies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>City Priorities</h3>
                  <p>During State of City Address aired Sept 13th, Mayor Bieter suggested that the City of Boise should ban new construction in the foothills… he said: “I think collectively we need to say NO MORE (implied: development).  You know the foothills, Ladies and Gentlemen, are too precious”.  This development is an excellent showcase to demonstrate the City’s sincerity regarding said priorities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Leveling Our Foothills</h3>
                  <p>The developer plans require leveling prominent ridgelines that are visible from as far away as Chinden Boulevard.  Most of both parcels are steeper than 25% and deemed unbuildable in the City's Hillside ordinance. Moreover, road grade requirements on the unbuildable lot would require destruction of natural foothill contours.  The developer's engineers have not done the grading analysis and could not answer specific questions as to the extent of grading required for the road and lots proposed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Unbuild-ability</h3>
                  <p>The developer contends that the lot designated 'unbuildable' was set aside and approved for future development in the existing Conditional Use Permit.  Neighborhood research and discussions with the City suggests that it was set aside as 'unbuildable' due to its steepness and need for open space. The unbuildable lot is contiguous to Hillside to the Hollow Reserve, and is an essential piece to trail connectivity, a city priority.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Landslides/Erosion</h3>
                  <p>There are many examples of hillside erosion and landslides directly resulting from development in the foothills. Significant tax payer funds have been used to settle lawsuits in other foothills development that experienced sliding and destruction of homes. We do not want to see more.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Contradictions</h3>
                  <p>Some homeowners said the developer mislead them relative to the unbuildable lot. The developer has admitted that the 12 acre parcel is “too steep to build” when trying to sell adjacent homes to potential buyers.  This was research they used before purchasing their homes.</p>
